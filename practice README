If you want to execute java program.
do
javac -d . practice/"java program's name"
or just
javac practice/"java program's name"
perheps Ok,
and
java practice."class name (exclude .class modifier)"
from masa-examples directory.

Or you can execute from jar file(s).
Clone jar file and make it executable and run it.
In my Ubuntu environment choose jar file by right click and proceed to
Properties > Permissions and check "Allow executing file as program"
of Execute row.
